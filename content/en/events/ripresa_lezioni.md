From 03 June 2020 lessons restart at San Niccol√≤'s gym!
Lessons will be taken in respect of laws regarding Covid-19 until the end of the emergency.
The gym has adopted precautions to keep everyone safe.
You'll find disinfectant gel, the entrance and the exit are separated and the place will be
sanitized at the end of each lesson.
You are asked to sign your presence each time on a paper that you'll find at the entrance
in order to avoid the virus spreading.
Thanks for your collaboration
